# Flappybird-C-with-Easy-X
a rough implementation of the game flappybird, and almost pure C with Easy X
Visual Studio as IDE

### problems solved
* make the background of the bird and tube picture transparent
* deal with the tube crash more accurately
****
### major problem at present
* the tubes and the bird keep flashing irregularly
even though I have use the default Batch Draw function in the plug-in.
